In other words, they wish to achieve civilizations comparable to those of the Western technological nations, but are severely handicapped at present by lack of intelligent, well-educated manpower to provide the necessary professionals, teachers, administrators and technicians.

Interestingly, the transition of filovirus species causing outbreaks in Central and West Africa during 2005–2014 seemed to be synchronized with the change of the serologically dominant virus species in these bats. These data suggest the introduction of multiple species of filoviruses in the migratory bat population and point to the need for continued … ",https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=BKzcUIIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=BKzcUIIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC

Yet, while a plethora of research examines its material aspects, the relational dimensions of poverty remain under-researched and are still not well understood. This research contributes to addressing that gap. Using recognition theory as a theoretical lens, the thesis investigates the question: ‘how do social relationships frame people’s experience of poverty?’ It explores the question through a qualitative case study of people in poverty in a rural district in Eastern Zambia. Zambia’s deep values of community and high levels of poverty provided unique opportunities to examine the role of social relationships in the experience of poverty. The thesis shows that poverty is experienced as suffering involving psychological pain and ontological insecurity. Feelings and the fear of indignity and shame, based in social interaction, are central to poverty. However, this interaction may also insulate people in poverty from some of its consequences such as social exclusion. The thesis affirms poverty as based in forms of recognition accorded to individuals in various domains of their lives. It highlights how lack of recognition in institutional relationships, including citizenship status, underpins conditions of material deprivation which are then reinforced by insufficient recognition at the level of informal relationships.

The 2010 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey used a nationally representative sample of about 20,000 households. This study found that urban households, households with higher income, and households with younger, more educated and male heads were more likely to be food-secure. Therefore, there is need to accelerate investments in formal education, narrow the rural–urban socioeconomic divide, and reduce gender inequities through deliberate policies to increase women’s access to and … ",https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=ak7wEb0AAAAJ&citation_for_view=ak7wEb0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC

Yet, while a plethora of research examines its material aspects, the relational dimensions of poverty remain under-researched and are still not well understood. This research contributes to addressing that gap. Using recognition theory as a theoretical lens, the thesis investigates the question: ‘how do social relationships frame people’s experience of poverty?’ It explores the question through a qualitative case study of people in poverty in a rural district in Eastern Zambia. Zambia’s deep values of community and high levels of poverty provided unique opportunities to examine the role of social relationships in the experience of poverty. The thesis shows that poverty is experienced as suffering involving psychological pain and ontological insecurity. Feelings and the fear of indignity and shame, based in social interaction, are central to poverty. However, this interaction may also insulate people in poverty from some of its consequences such as social exclusion. The thesis affirms poverty as based in forms of recognition accorded to individuals in various domains of their lives. It highlights how lack of recognition in institutional relationships, including citizenship status, underpins conditions of material deprivation which are then reinforced by insufficient recognition at the level of informal relationships. In this way, the work contributes new and unique insights into how poverty is inherently relational and lies at the intersection of processes of exclusion and subordinate inclusion.

In Malawi, cervical cancer ranks as the first most frequent cancer in women between 15 and 64 years of age. We aimed at providing data about the distribution of different histological types of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions in patients presenting at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Malawi. Methods: A total of 212 patient samples collected from 1st January, 2014 through 31st December, 2014 were included in the study. Tissue Hematoxylin and Eosin staining technique for microscopic histopathological classification of cervical lesions was used. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS® version 20.0 for windows. The chisquare and Multinomial logistic regression test with a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance of the results. Results: Out of 212 cases having precancerous lesions and cervical cancer that were included in the study, cervical lesions comprised 17%(35/212) pre-cancerous lesions, 65%(137/212) cancerous and 18%(39/212) had both pre-cancerous and cervical cancer, making a total of 176 (83%) cancer lesions. The most common cervical lesion was squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with 72%(151/212) cases.

We conducted this study to determine whether the Zambian women presenting with breast cancer at the University Teaching Hospital express CK5/6 protein. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted to evaluate 44 conveniently sampled breast tissue diagnosed with breast cancer on histology at the University Teaching Hospital. The breast tissue was stained with CK 5/6 antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The Labelled Streptavidin Binding (LSAB) staining was used to amplify and view the reaction. Pearson-chi-square test was used to indicate statistical significance of the findings. Results: Results revealed that 23 (52%) of the 44 samples tested negative for CK5/6 while 21 (48%) were positive as shown in table 2. Out of the 23 samples that tested positive, 18 were ductal carcinoma while 5 were lobular carcinoma (P= 0.023). Conclusion: In our study close to half of the tissue specimen were positive for the monoclonal antibody CK 5/6. This is highly suggestive of the presence of Basal like tumours in Zambian patients.

We found that there is a strong upregulation of genes for factors that promote apoptosis in PBMC from individuals with active disease, including TNF‐α and its receptors, Fas and FasL and pro‐Caspase 8. The anti‐apoptotic factor FLIP, however, was also upregulated.

Aim: This study explored the learning approaches and teaching style preferences of pharmacy students in Zambia. Methods: The research instrument was the ‘Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students’(ASSIST) questionnaire. Data were collected from 147 undergraduate pharmacy students at University of Zambia and statistically analysed using Stata 13. Results: Strategic learning approach was predominant among a majority (67%) of pharmacy students. Only 25% adopted a deep learning approach and 7% were surface learners. Learning approach was statistically significantly associated with course load (p= 0.028) and programme stage (p= 0.010). The majority (67%) preferred teaching that transmitted information while only 23% preferred teaching styles that encouraged and supported understanding of taught material. There was no statistical association between students’ learning approach and their teaching style preference (p= 0.085). Conclusion: The predominance of strategic learning approach and preference for teaching that transmitted information raises concerns on current educational strategies employed by both the curriculum and educators. ,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=KLNnZyUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=KLNnZyUAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC

In Zambia, neem leaf extract is applied by small scale farmers to enhance soil fertility and promote crop productivity. This study reports the suitability of aqueous neem leaf extract as a soil amendment and its effect on soil microbial biomass and activity in local soils. Neem leaves were characterized before being used to prepare aqueous neem extract in the concentrations 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% in water.

Recently, Kaposi's sarcoma cases have increased in Zambia. However, the diagnosis of this disease is based on morphological appearance of affected tissues using histological techniques, and the association with its causative agent, Human Herpes virus 8 is not sought. This means poor prognosis for affected patients since the causative agent is not targeted during diagnosis and KS lesions may be mistaken for other reactive and neoplastic vascular proliferations when only histological techniques are used. Therefore, this study was aimed at providing evidence of Human Herpes virus 8 infection in Kaposi's sarcoma tissues at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: One hundred and twenty suspected Kaposi's sarcoma archival formalinfixed paraffin-wax embedded tissues stored from January 2013 to December 2014 in the Histopathology Laboratory at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia were analysed using histology and Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting the ORF26 gene of Human Herpes virus 8. Results: The predominant histological type of Kaposi's sarcoma detected was the Nodular type (60.7%) followed by the plaque type (22.6%) and patch type (16.7%). The nodular lesion was identified mostly in males (40.5%, 34/84) than females (20.2%, 17/84)(p= 0.041).

However, in Zambia during the diagnosis of these lymphomas, the association of the virus with the lymphomas is not established. Since most patients with lymphomas have poor prognosis, the identification of the virus within the lymphoma lesion will allow for more targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the presence of the EBV in lymphomas diagnosed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: one hundred and fifty archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded suspected lymphoma tissues stored over a 4-year period in the Histopathology Laboratory at the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia, were analysed. Histological methods were used to identify the lymphomas, and the virus was detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subtyping of the virus was achieved through DNA sequencing of the EBNA-2 region of the viral genome. Chi square or fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association between EBV status, type of lymphoma and gender. Results: the majority of the lymphomas identified were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)(80%) followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)(20%). EBV was detected in 51.8% of the cases, 54.5% of which were associated with NHL cases, while 40.9% associated with HL cases. The predominant subtype of the virus in both types of lymphomas was subtype 1. One of the lymphoma cases harboured both subtype 1 and 2 of the virus.

However, adjunct to these markers, 1, 5 anhydroglucitol (1, 5AG), has since been introduced as a surrogate marker for diabetes. Because of limited capacity by routine blood and urine glucose tests in monitoring glycemic control over period of time, HbA1c and 1, 5AG have the ability to predict diabetic complications and glycemic control over weeks and months. Our objective was to compare the monitoring of HbA1c and 1, 5AG biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 44 diabetic individuals and 42 non-diabetic individuals of age ranging from 20 to 80 years at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. The threshold was set at various cutoff points for glycated hemoglobin A1c and 1, 5AG, respectively.

Insulin being an anabolic hormone promotes synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides, whereas insulin deficiency tends to increase mobilisation of fatty acids from triacylglycerols and increase fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase (FASN) complex in mammalian cells. We carried out an analytical cross sectional study to find out the link between serum insulin and serum FASN levels. A total of 44 participants, 22 with type 2diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 22 normal non-diabetic controls were recruited. Serum insulin and circulating FASN were assessed in T2DM patients and non-diabetic control subjects. Our results showed that diabetics have significantly higher insulin and FASN levels (p< 0.0001 and p= 0.018 respectively) than non-diabetics. Insulin levels were found to be significantly correlated to FASN in controls (r= 0.476, p= 0.034). A non-significant correlation between serum insulin and circulating FASN was observed in diabetic participants (r= 0.333)(p= 0.139. In conclusion our results suggest that hyperinsulinaemia is a feature of T2DM and insulin increases serum concentration of FASN; hence the increased levels of serum FASN in diabetics with hyperinsulinaemia.

Each of these conditions predisposes to the other, and their concomitant presence has additive adverse effects. This study examined the clinical factors associated with AF in CHF patients admitted to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study done in the admission wards of the UTH involving adult patients with the primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure. The data was collected from July 2014 to September 2014. A structured interview schedule was used to capture the socio-demographic and related historical data. Then all patients had a standard 12-lead ECG done on them to check for AF. Those participants with no AF on a standard 12-lead ECG had 24-hours ECG DR180+ Digital Recorder applied to try to pick-up paroxysmal AF. Finally all participants with AF were assessed for clinical factors (ie sex, age, BMI, smoking, excessive alcohol intake, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and chronic lung disease). Pearson chi-square of independence of the data was used to analyze the data in SPSS® 20.0 to determine clinical factors of AF in CHF patients.

Active Cycle of Breathing Techniques (ACBT) is traditionally used by Physiotherapists in the management of respiratory conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological effects of ACBT on pulmonary function in stable heart failure (HF) patients (New York Heart Association Functional class II and III) at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: This prospective cohort study investigated the pulmonary function response to ACBT in heart failure patients at UTH Lusaka, Zambia. A Minnesota questionnaire was used to collect anthropometric and QoL data; respiratory function tests were done by a handheld spirometer at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. ACBT were conducted on 3 days of the week for a total of 12 weeks. STATA version 11.2 was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 23 patients, mean age 54.0 years (range 25-77), participated in the study. The lung function volumes were reduced at baseline as expected (FVC= 2.9 L, FEV 1= 2.0 L and FEV 1/FVC= 70.1%). There was hardly any change at 6 weeks (FVC= 2.7 L, FEV 1= 1.9 L and FEV 1/FVC= 70.2%). There was a slight increase in the means at 12 weeks (FVC= 2.8 L, FEV 1= 2.0 L and FEV 1/FVC= 73.0%) which was statistically insignificant (p= 0.73).

Many of the camps have since been closed and currently there are only two officially designated refugees’ settlement areas at Meheba in Kalumbila district in North-Western Province and Mayukwayukwa in Kaoma district of Western Province. As of December 2016, Zambia was hosting a total of about 57,209 refugees, former refugees and other people of concern–mostly in the two refugee settlements, self-settled in five provinces and other urban areas mostly in the Copperbelt and Lusaka. The refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo form the largest group at 23,250 people; former refugees from Angola at 19,800; from Rwanda at 6,236 (of whom 4,740 are former refugees); from Burundi at 4,434; from Somalia at 3,064; and from other countries at 389. Angolan refugees were the first to seek a safe haven in Zambia in 1967 and were, for many years the largest and most significant refugee group. However, since 2004, over 132,000 Angolan refugees voluntarily repatriated back to their country of origin.

Many methods and devices for adult male circumcision have now been developed. However, there are still concerns on safety, duration of procedure, and public acceptability of these devices. Objectives: to assess safety, duration of procedure, complications, pain and public acceptability of the Taraklamp, male circumcision device, in adolescents and adult male circumcision in Zambia. Materials and Methods: we conducted a field study with 1,046 male adolescents and adults recruited from five district clinics. Prior to circumcision, participants were educated on benefits of circumcision while undergoing HIV counseling and screening. Duration of procedure was recorded, intra and postoperative pain was assessed and adverse events were documented for each participant. Levels of satisfaction with the procedure both from doctors' and participants' perspectives were also documented. Results: A total of 794 participants were circumcised using the TARAKLAMP device. The median time for circumcision was 4 minutes (IQR: 3-6 minutes; range: 1-24 minutes). Approximately 5 (0.6%) of the participants experienced postoperative pain and 12 (1.5%) experienced adverse events following the procedure. Despite this all participants found the procedure safe and acceptable, as did the doctors who carried out the procedure.

Recently, Kaposi's sarcoma cases have increased in Zambia. However, the diagnosis of this disease is based on morphological appearance of affected tissues using histological techniques, and the association with its causative agent, Human Herpes virus 8 is not sought. This means poor prognosis for affected patients since the causative agent is not targeted during diagnosis and KS lesions may be mistaken for other reactive and neoplastic vascular proliferations when only histological techniques are used. Therefore, this study was aimed at providing evidence of Human Herpes virus 8 infection in Kaposi's sarcoma tissues at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: One hundred and twenty suspected Kaposi's sarcoma archival formalinfixed paraffin-wax embedded tissues stored from January 2013 to December 2014 in the Histopathology Laboratory at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia were analysed using histology and Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting the ORF26 gene of Human Herpes virus 8. Results: The predominant histological type of Kaposi's sarcoma detected was the Nodular type (60.7%) followed by the plaque type (22.6%) and patch type (16.7%). The nodular lesion was identified mostly in males (40.5%, 34/84) than females (20.2%, 17/84)(p= 0.041). Human Herpes virus 8 DNA was detected in 53.6%(45/84) and mostly in the nodular KS lesions (60%, 27/84)(p= 0.035).

However, in Zambia during the diagnosis of these lymphomas, the association of the virus with the lymphomas is not established. Since most patients with lymphomas have poor prognosis, the identification of the virus within the lymphoma lesion will allow for more targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the presence of the EBV in lymphomas diagnosed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: one hundred and fifty archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded suspected lymphoma tissues stored over a 4-year period in the Histopathology Laboratory at the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia, were analysed. Histological methods were used to identify the lymphomas, and the virus was detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subtyping of the virus was achieved through DNA sequencing of the EBNA-2 region of the viral genome. Chi square or fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association between EBV status, type of lymphoma and gender. Results: the majority of the lymphomas identified were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)(80%) followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)(20%). EBV was detected in 51.8% of the cases, 54.5% of which were associated with NHL cases, while 40.9% associated with HL cases. The predominant subtype of the virus in both types of lymphomas was subtype 1. One of the lymphoma cases harboured both subtype 1 and 2 of the virus.

The aim of this study was to determine the histological phenotypes and cell orientation of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in indigenous black Zambians as presented at the university Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective cross section study conducted to evaluate 30 conveniently sampled non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues from the year 2012 in the Histopathology laboratory at the University Teaching Hospital for a six month period. The specimens came from patients with age range 4 to 65 years. Tissues were cut for Histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining using a microtome. Haematoxylin and Eosin staining was done on slides to confirm their non-Hodgkin lymphoma status. They then underwent Immunohistochemical staining, and the following panel of primary antibodies were used: CD45, CD20, CD3 and CD79a (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The Labelled Streptavidin Binding (LSAB) staining was used to amplify and view the reaction. Statistical Analysis: Data was analysed using SPSS version 16.0 software for windows; Univariate analysis of variables age, sex, histology and antibody profiles was conducted to determine the distribution patterns of the Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Design: An explorative descriptive design study was conducted at three major chest clinics in Livingstone; namely Livingstone General Hospital, Mahatma Gandhi and Sepo health centers. The study population was all the TB/HIV co-infected patients aged between 18 and 49 years who were referred for HAART in the previous one month or more prior to the study and were not critically ill. The respondents were selected using systematic sampling method. A total number of 131 TB/HIV coinfected patients who were being attended to at the selected chest clinics in Livingstone were enrolled into the study. Data were collected using a structured interview schedule and focus group discussion guide to enable the investigator collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Epi-info version 6 and SPSS 12.0 for windows software computer packages were used to analyze the quantitative data. Chi-square was used to measure association between the dependent variable (acceptability of HAART by TB patients) and the independent variables. With the confidence interval set at 95%, the p value was used to ascertain the degree of significance by using the decision rule which rejects the null hypothesis if p value is equal or less than 0.05.

Before this period there were 75 years of colonial administration during which most of the provision of education was mainly in the hands of missionaries (Simposya, 2003). At independence there were already two education systems running parallel on racial lines: well-financed, for colonial masters, and poorly financed and basic for the natives (Simposya, 2003). After independence, the decade which followed (1964–74) is still considered by many researchers as a period of relative success in development of the country’s infrastructure, and also social-economic gains (Kelly, 1991; Carmody, 2004). It is within this period that Zambia realized formal education up to university level. In 1975, Zambia’s economic fortunes plummeted with the world decline in the price of copper, Zambia’s main export. The next 15 years saw negligible GDP growth, high rates ofjoblessness and the increasing inability of the state to finance basic health, sanitation and education services for its citizens (Gillies, 2010). In the context of education commentators, they called the provision as ‘education in the declining economy’. In 1991, Zambia reverted to a multiparty system of government. The state of Zambia’s education sector in 1991 was influenced by the copper crisis, Zambia’s subsequent economic decline, the deterioration of government institutions and services, and the increasing demand for education (Gillies, 2010).

In this work, we design a charge controller based on the microprocessor, which offers increased reliability, reduced cost, reduced complexity in the number of electronic components and increased monitoring and regulative functions. This controller is designed for simplicity by using a commonly applied domestic embedded systems microcontroller-the Motorola 6811 series. The advantage of using a microprocessor based system is that it is possible to alter the general parameters and specifications of the charge controller by simply altering the voltage parameters in the software via a user interface.

Recent reports indicate that the root could possess uterotonic substances. Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate three methods for the extraction of uterotonic principles from the root of S. araliacea growing in Zambia. Methods: Roots of the plant were collected from Chongwe District of Zambia. The air-dried roots were size-reduced, and the powdered material extracted with hot ethanol, hot distilled water, and cold distilled water. The solvent extracts were concentrated and dried at 110 0C. Solutions of the hot aqueous and cold aqueous extracts were prepared in distilled water and used for organ bath experiments to demonstrate uterotonic activities using strips of pregnant rat uterus. The frequencies and amplitude of contractile forces were recorded. The amplitudes were plotted against log concentration of extract with GraphPad Prism software, and the EC50 values determined. Results: The percentage yields were 31.3% for the hot aqueous extract, 8.15% for the ethanolic extract, and 3.27% for the cold aqueous extract. The cold aqueous extract showed higher potency (EC50 of 0.54 mg/ml) compared to the hot aqueous extract (EC50 of 2.09 mg/ml).

Recently, Kaposi's sarcoma cases have increased in Zambia. However, the diagnosis of this disease is based on morphological appearance of affected tissues using histological techniques, and the association with its causative agent, Human Herpes virus 8 is not sought. This means poor prognosis for affected patients since the causative agent is not targeted during diagnosis and KS lesions may be mistaken for other reactive and neoplastic vascular proliferations when only histological techniques are used. Therefore, this study was aimed at providing evidence of Human Herpes virus 8 infection in Kaposi's sarcoma tissues at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: One hundred and twenty suspected Kaposi's sarcoma archival formalinfixed paraffin-wax embedded tissues stored from January 2013 to December 2014 in the Histopathology Laboratory at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia were analysed using histology and Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting the ORF26 gene of Human Herpes virus 8.

However, in Zambia during the diagnosis of these lymphomas, the association of the virus with the lymphomas is not established. Since most patients with lymphomas have poor prognosis, the identification of the virus within the lymphoma lesion will allow for more targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the presence of the EBV in lymphomas diagnosed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: one hundred and fifty archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded suspected lymphoma tissues stored over a 4-year period in the Histopathology Laboratory at the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia, were analysed. Histological methods were used to identify the lymphomas, and the virus was detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subtyping of the virus was achieved through DNA sequencing of the EBNA-2 region of the viral genome. Chi square or fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association between EBV status, type of lymphoma and gender. Results: the majority of the lymphomas identified were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)(80%) followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)(20%). EBV was detected in 51.8% of the cases, 54.5% of which were associated with NHL cases, while 40.9% associated with HL cases.

Results: The highest yearly age-adjusted hospitalization rates were 30.6 and 31.1 per 100,000 populations for 2008 and 2009, respectively. In 2008, the highest hospitalization rate was among those aged 65 yrs and older; in 2009, the highest rate was among those younger than 5 yrs.

Within the country, all provinces are malaria endemic although the transmission intensities vary mainly depending on environmental factors as they interact with the vectors. Generally in Africa, possibly due to the varying perspectives and methods used there is no consensus on the relative importance of malaria risk determinants despite the many studies done so far. In Zambia, it is equally not clear what the role climatic factors play on malaria case rates, as no current studies have determined the factors over space and time using robust methods in modelling, considering the reversal in malaria reduction after the year 2010 and the variation by transmission zones. Methods: Using a geoadditive or structured additive Semiparametric Poisson regression model, we determined the influence of climatic factors on malaria incidence in four endemic provinces of Zambia. Results and Conclusions: We demonstrate a strong positive association between malaria incidence and precipitation as well as minimum temperature. The risk of malaria was 95% lower in Lusaka (ARR= 0.05, 95% CI= 0.04-0.06) and 68% lower in the Western Province (ARR= 0.31, 95% CI= 0.25-0.41) compared to Luapula Province. North-western Province did not vary from Luapula Province. The effects of geographical region are clearly demonstrated by the unique behaviour and effects of minimum and maximum temperatures in the four provinces.

A cross-sectional survey on knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) on malaria transmission, prevention and control was conducted among 584 household heads of randomly selected communities in Luapula, Lusaka, North-western and Western provinces in Zambia. Data was analysed by both descriptive and inferential statistics. Knowledge levels in malaria with regards to the mosquito being the vector and the capacity of malaria to kill were high in all the provinces and did not vary statistically. The two main sources of malaria information were health facility and radio. From the regression analysis, pain killer use was associated with high incomes, employment, secondary education or higher and the knowledge of fever as a sign for malaria.

The Machile-Zambezi Basin is part of the wider Kalahari Basin which underwent major palaeo-environmental climatic, tectonic and sedimentology dynamics which must have impacted the groundwater salinity. The study examines the groundwater level, hydrochemistry, environmental isotopes (18O/16O, 2H/1H, 3H/3He, 14C/13C). In addition, the sediment cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pore-water chemistry on intact core material were measured. The groundwater chemistry evolved from fresh Ca(Na)HCO3 to saline Na(Ca, Mg)SO4 due to dissolution of salts and not evaporation as indicated by stable isotopes.

The secondary objective was to assess the immediate impact of the training on the perceived competence of trainees who attended the Mid Level Management (MLM) course on immunisation. Methods: A needs assessment of the EPI programme in Zambia was conducted. Participants were assessed on their ability, competence, knowledge and skills in areas such as understanding the Reach Every District (RED) strategy, vaccine management, cold chain management, and immunisation monitoring. Based on these assessments, 12 areas were identified as of particular relevance, and the World Health Organisation MLM course manual was adapted to reflect them. Two groups of 25 participants were assessed at two different time points with an interval of six months. Results: There was a significant increase (p< 0.05) after training in the participants' perceived ability, competence, knowledge and skills in all the targeted areas except for understanding the RED strategy, capacity to supervise immunisation activities and immunisation coverage.

This study aimed to identify and quantify many of the factors contributing to overall consumption, through extensive surveys of four widely differing dense medium mineral separation plants, and associated laboratory experiments. Particular attention was given to the effect of operating density on medium loss. It was concluded that quite modest increases in operating density significantly increased loss from all sources. Density should therefore be minimised, commensurate with process requirements. There is also unequivocal evidence that consumption increases significantly with plant downtime, probably due to housekeeping wastage and overloading of regeneration circuits during the return of dumped medium to circuit.

Recently, Kaposi's sarcoma cases have increased in Zambia. However, the diagnosis of this disease is based on morphological appearance of affected tissues using histological techniques, and the association with its causative agent, Human Herpes virus 8 is not sought. This means poor prognosis for affected patients since the causative agent is not targeted during diagnosis and KS lesions may be mistaken for other reactive and neoplastic vascular proliferations when only histological techniques are used. Therefore, this study was aimed at providing evidence of Human Herpes virus 8 infection in Kaposi's sarcoma tissues at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: One hundred and twenty suspected Kaposi's sarcoma archival formalinfixed paraffin-wax embedded tissues stored from January 2013 to December 2014 in the Histopathology Laboratory at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia were analysed using histology and Polymerase Chain Reaction targeting the ORF26 gene of Human Herpes virus 8. Results: The predominant histological type of Kaposi's sarcoma detected was the Nodular type (60.7%) followed by the plaque type (22.6%) and patch type (16.7%). The nodular lesion was identified mostly in males (40.5%, 34/84) than females (20.2%, 17/84)(p= 0.041). Human Herpes virus 8 DNA was detected in 53.6%(45/84) and mostly in the nodular KS lesions (60%, 27/84)(p= 0.035).

However, in Zambia during the diagnosis of these lymphomas, the association of the virus with the lymphomas is not established. Since most patients with lymphomas have poor prognosis, the identification of the virus within the lymphoma lesion will allow for more targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of the presence of the EBV in lymphomas diagnosed at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: one hundred and fifty archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded suspected lymphoma tissues stored over a 4-year period in the Histopathology Laboratory at the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia, were analysed. Histological methods were used to identify the lymphomas, and the virus was detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Subtyping of the virus was achieved through DNA sequencing of the EBNA-2 region of the viral genome. Chi square or fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the association between EBV status, type of lymphoma and gender. Results: the majority of the lymphomas identified were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)(80%) followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL)(20%). EBV was detected in 51.8% of the cases, 54.5% of which were associated with NHL cases, while 40.9% associated with HL cases. The predominant subtype of the virus in both types of lymphomas was subtype 1. One of the lymphoma cases harboured both subtype 1 and 2 of the virus.

Among other things it prompted the formation of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) in Zambia. It began in 1990 as a civil society movement to fight for the re-introduction of multiparty politics after 18 years of one-party rule by the United National Independence Party (UNIP) and became a political party following the repeal in 1990 of Article 4 of the Republic Constitution to allow for the formation of parties other than UNIP. Starting with its defeat of UNIP in the first multiparty election of 1991 the MMP has carried four consecutive general elections, winning again in 1996, 2001 and 2006. This paper traces the evolution of the MMD from its formation and examines the issues associated with Zambia’s political and governance climate that have helped to shape the MMD. The discussion essentially centres on six of these questions. The first is the genesis of the MMD from its formation as a pressure group to campaign for the re-introduction of a multiparty system. It specifically looks at such aspects as the groupings that constituted the nascent MMD, and the factors that made the new party sufficiently attractive to the electorate for it to win a large majority in the 1991 presidential and parliamentary elections.

Post-stroke outcomes vary widely, between and within world regions depending on a range of factors including demographic profile, stroke type, severity and immediate and long-term post stroke care. It has been reported that early initiation of rehabilitation following stroke promotes better long-term outcomes than delayed rehabilitation, although this has been disputed by some researchers in the AVERT (A very early rehabilitation trial) study. Purpose of Review: To evaluate the best time to start stroke rehabilitation with good outcomes Results of the Review: There is limited evidence to show that later rehabilitation is better than early rehabilitation. It also remains unclear whether early mobilization is more effective than mobilization at a later stage, due to insufficient statistical power of the studies that have examined this practice because clinicians around the world are practicing this model to this day. Furthermore, some trial limitations of the AVERT study in line with the uncertainty of the external validity of the results, make generalizability something to be concerned about.

Prior research from science education shows that student understandings of science concepts and phenomena are frequently at odds with scientific laws and principles. Students bring to formal instruction a repertoire of intuitive knowledge of the physical world that they develop through their interpretation and assimilation of daily life experiences. These intuitive understandings are robust and appear to be strongly resistant to instruction. As a consequence, finding pedagogical tools and strategies that help students change their intuitive understandings of physics systems is currently a great concern in education research. Because it is hard to predict how teaching-tools and methods work in light of students’ repertoire of intuitive knowledge, it is important to thoroughly test new teaching interventions.  Dynamic systems consist of stocks and flows. Stocks represent things that can be accumulated over time, and flows are the rates at which stocks change. In the field of System Dynamics, the stock and flow (SF) model is usually introduced through a water tank or bathtub analogy, and stock and flow diagrams (SFDs) are used as a tool for conceptualizing and representing dynamic systems. This thesis explores how students develop a scientific understanding of Newton’s First and Second Law as they use the water tank analogy to make sense of motion phenomena.

This is to facilitate the development of tailor-made antistigma initiatives that are culturally sensitive for Zambia and other low-income African countries. This is the first in-depth study on mental illness stigma in Zambia. Method: Fifty semi-structured interviews and 6 focus group discussions were conducted with key stakeholders drawn from 3 districts in Zambia (Lusaka, Kabwe and Sinazongwe). Transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results: Mental illness stigma and discrimination is pervasive across Zambian society, prevailing within the general community, amongst family members, amid general and mental health care providers, and at the level of government. Such stigma appears to be fuelled by misunderstandings of mental illness aetiology; fears of contagion and the perceived dangerousness of people with mental illness; and associations between HIV/AIDS and mental illness. Strategies suggested for reducing stigma and discrimination in Zambia included education campaigns, the transformation of mental health policy and legislation and expanding the social and economic opportunities of the mentally ill.

Other sources of data were Health Management Information System (2004-2008) and Censuses 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000. Trends in U5MR were mapped for various parameters levels and patterns of U5MR, distribution by geographical areas and cause of death. Results: U5MR in Zambia has had periods of improvement and regression and is currently estimated at 119 deaths per thousand live births. Thirty four percent (34%) of all deaths among under-five children occur in the neonatal period (0-28 days); while 48% occur in the post-neonatal period and more than a half (53%) of neonates die within the first week of their life. Marked disparities in the levels of under-five mortality between and within provinces exist, raising issues of equity in health services.

Materials and methods: Antibodies against neuronal peptides were used to study changes in hepatic nerve fibres after exposure to BPA at varying concentrations using standard immunofluorescence techniques. The neuropeptides investigated were substance P (SP), galanin (GAL), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), calcitonin gene regulated peptide (CGRP) and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). Immunoreactive nerve fibres were counted in multiple sections of the liver and among multiple animals at varying exposure levels. The data was pooled and presented as mean±standard error of the mean. Results: It was found that all of the nerve fibres investigated showed upregulation of these neural markers after BPA exposure, even at exposure levels currently considered to be safe. These results show very dramatic increases in nerve fibres containing the above-mentioned neuropeptides and the altered neurochemical levels may be causing a range of pathophysiological states if the trend of over-expression is extrapolated to developing humans. Conclusions: This may have serious implications for children and young adults who are exposed to this very common plastic polymer, if the same trends are occurring in humans.

The consequences of widespread failure to implement public policies are very evident in almost all African countries—dysrhythmic development between rural and urban areas, collapsing infrastructure and social services that depend on it, run-down economies as epitomized by debased national currencies and colossal foreign debts; in short a confounding underdevelopment that has reduced the honeymoon of political independence to a dystopian nightmare.

However the deepening crisis in its multidimensionality has led certain observers to question whether or not African countries possess adequate capacity to formulate, implement, let alone evaluate, coherent public policies. At a recent seminar on the theme of “Capability Building for policy Change and Sustainability: Lessons from the African Experience', held in Arusha, Tanzania between 3 and 6 June 1991 the chorus of partici-pants was unmistakably clear on this issue: the capacity to both formulate and manage public policies in many African countries … ",https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=_iatTkUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_iatTkUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC

The current study sought to establish the level of Sign language competency among teachers of children who are deaf in 10 of the primary schools in Bulawayo that enroll children who are deaf. A descriptive survey and ex-post facto research designs were employed in soliciting data from a sample of 15 teachers of the deaf and 5 college lecturers. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and a Modified Sign Language Proficiency Interview (MSLPI) on a 6-Point rating scale. Document analysis and observation were used to authenticate responses from college lecturers and teachers of the deaf respectively. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and descriptive summaries were used to analyse data. The data indicated that teachers of the deaf in Bulawayo lacked Sign Language proficiency.

Recognizing the importance of early childhood development (ECD), the Zambian government has committed to scaling up ECD programmes that support health, nutrition, and early learning/stimulation for children. Progress from these programmes have been mixed: between 2007 and 2014 the infant mortality rate dropped from 70 per 1,000 live births to 45, while the broader under-5 mortality rate fell from 119 per 1,000 live births to 75 (CSO, 2014). These rates, however, remain substantially higher than the Millennium Development Goals targets of 63.5 and 35.7, respectively.

Pharm.) degree programme which follows a four-year curriculum structure. The B. Pharm. programme aims to produce pharmacists with requisite competences to practise pharmaceutical care and sustain the development of pharmacy in Zambia. Seventeen years down the line, Zambia continues to advance local pharmaceutical education programmes. Over 700 pharmacists have graduated from the national training programmes in Zambia which continue to address the pharmaceutical workforce needs. Pharmaceutical education in Zambia offers a number of career prospects in hospital, community, pharmaceutical manufacturing, medicine regulation, public health administration, and progression to academia. Positive transitions made to advance pharmacists’ training in Zambia give a positive outlook for the future.

Aim: This study explored the learning approaches and teaching style preferences of pharmacy students in Zambia. Methods: The research instrument was the ‘Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students’(ASSIST) questionnaire. Data were collected from 147 undergraduate pharmacy students at University of Zambia and statistically analysed using Stata 13. Results: Strategic learning approach was predominant among a majority (67%) of pharmacy students. Only 25% adopted a deep learning approach and 7% were surface learners. Learning approach was statistically significantly associated with course load (p= 0.028) and programme stage (p= 0.010). The majority (67%) preferred teaching that transmitted information while only 23% preferred teaching styles that encouraged and supported understanding of taught material. There was no statistical association between students’ learning approach and their teaching style preference (p= 0.085). Conclusion: The predominance of strategic learning approach and preference for teaching that transmitted information raises concerns on current educational strategies employed by both the curriculum and educators. ,https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=5MK3ZJoAAAAJ&citation_for_view=5MK3ZJoAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC

Prior to the year 2000, there were very few pharmacists in professional practice locally. Records indicate that the first locally trained pharmacist was registered by the Medical Council of Zambia (now Health Professions Council of Zambia) in 2004 following the introduction of undergraduate Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) training at the University of Zambia (UNZA) in 2001. Since then a number of pharmacists have joined the profession annually after graduating from UNZA. The first intake of pharmacy students at UNZA had about 30 students which was almost a quarter of the pharmacists working in the country that time. From this intake, about 17 candidates successfully graduated to become pharmacists. Over the last decade and half, the profession has witnessed momentous growth in numbers of pharmacy professionals entering the local practice with over 400 pharmacists produced by UNZA to date. Majority of these pharmacists have since gone on to assume various professional service roles in both public and private health sector in Zambia and abroad. Moreover, it is still envisaged that more pharmacists are in the production pipeline from the local training institutions. On hindsight, Zambia also continues to receive quite a number of pharmacists trained from abroad coming to practice pharmacy locally.

However, this reality is more pronounced in African society in that personal names are not just labels or appellations put on individuals to identify them in the community but rather words that reflect the world-view of people. This is also applicable to the Luvale people of Zambia. Indeed, among the Luvale, when a name is bestowed upon a child, the name-giver chooses a name that truly not only identifies the child as a person, but reflects the socio-cultural context or environment where the child is born.

Capacity building of state institutions and civil society organizations is considered an important means to enhance ownership of development processes, as well as take distance from the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Consequently, institutional capacity-building has been on the agenda of North-South partnerships between academic institutions in the so-called North and South. In this context, capacity building has set out to build more equal relationships, for example in research collaboration. Emphasis has increasingly been on the collaborative definition of agendas and joint dissemination of research inputs in academic publications. Such efforts have been seen as a contrast to old practices, where agendas were set by Northern institutions, and Southern partners often played the role of data collectors for case studies.(See Carbonnier and Kontinen 2014; 2015). Despite quite remarkable changes taking place in North-South relationships in academia, there are still hindrances to genuine collaboration. Most importantly, the funding schemes often attempt to combine the aspirations of both academia and development aid, sometimes leading to contradictory objectives and failures in this particular attempt.

Capacity building of state institutions and civil society organizations is considered an important means to enhance ownership of development processes, as well as take distance from the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Consequently, institutional capacity-building has been on the agenda of North-South partnerships between academic institutions in the so-called North and South. In this context, capacity building has set out to build more equal relationships, for example in research collaboration. Emphasis has increasingly been on the collaborative definition of agendas and joint dissemination of research inputs in academic publications. Such efforts have been seen as a contrast to old practices, where agendas were set by Northern institutions, and Southern partners often played the role of data collectors for case studies.(See Carbonnier and Kontinen 2014; 2015). Despite quite remarkable changes taking place in North-South relationships in academia, there are still hindrances to genuine collaboration. Most importantly, the funding schemes often attempt to combine the aspirations of both academia and development aid, sometimes leading to contradictory objectives and failures in this particular attempt. Funding from academic research agencies considers first and foremost the scientific quality, leaving little room for capacity building, whilst aid funding is often restricted to institutional capacity and excludes research and teaching activities.

It also estimates growth elasticities of poverty at all these levels. Finally, the paper uses poverty decomposition methods to assess how much of the observed reduction in poverty between 2006 and 2015 is due to growth and distribution changes. It is found that poverty is high for households that depend on agriculture.

However, in Zambia during the diagnosis of these lymphomas, the association of the virus with the lymphomas is not established.

Methods: one hundred and fifty archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded suspected lymphoma tissues stored over a 4-year period in the Histopathology Laboratory at the UTH in Lusaka, Zambia, were analysed. Histological methods were used to identify the lymphomas, and the virus was detected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

201,"<div id=""gsc_prf_in"">B H Chishala</div>","With declining fertility levels of soils and the high cost of agricultural inputs, such as commercial fertilizers and pesticides, the use of organic inputs has increased in Zambia. While neem products have been shown to improve soil fertility status, several negative effects on soil organisms have also been cited. The negative effects have been attributed to several secondary metabolites produced by the neem plant. In Zambia, neem leaf extract is applied by small scale farmers to enhance soil fertility and promote crop productivity. This study reports the suitability of aqueous neem leaf extract as a soil amendment and its effect on soil microbial biomass and activity in local soils. Neem leaves were characterized before being used to prepare aqueous neem extract in the concentrations 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% in water.

While neem products have been shown to improve soil fertility status, several negative effects on soil organisms have also been cited. The negative effects have been attributed to several secondary metabolites produced by the neem plant. In Zambia, neem leaf extract is applied by small scale farmers to enhance soil fertility and promote crop productivity. This study reports the suitability of aqueous neem leaf extract as a soil amendment and its effect on soil microbial biomass and activity in local soils. Neem leaves were characterized before being used to prepare aqueous neem extract in the concentrations 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% in water.

They are often overlooked in mainstream programmes and services designed to provide early education. They also do not receive the specific supports required to meet their rights and needs. Children with disabilities and their families are confronted by barriers including inadequate legislation and policies, negative attitudes, inadequate services, and lack of accessible environments. If children with disabilities and their families are not provided with timely and appropriate early education and support, their difficulties can become more severe and resulting into negative lifetime consequences, increased poverty and profound exclusion.

Materials and methods: Eight local goats (21±2 Kg) in individual metabolic cages were divided into two groups. One group received a 100 gm BMM daily supplement to basal diet (EMS+ 50 gm maize bran), while the other group did not receive any supplement. The experimental design was a 2x2 switchback with 7 days of adaptation and 5 days of sampling of orts, feces and urine. Feed intake was recorded and total fecal collection was done to analyze digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF), as well as N balance. Results: Goats receiving BMM supplement had higher (P< 0.05) intake and digestibility of the analyzed nutrients than the group without supplementation. BMM supplementation also significantly increased N intake and fecal N output, compared to those without supplementation. BMM-supplemented goats had significantly better N retention than those without supplementation.

The seeds remain dormant until they are chemically triggered by the host plant to germinate (Kwacha, 2001). The large number of parasitic seeds produced increases the chances that some Striga seeds will find a suitable host. Every year some seeds germinate, some revert to dormancy while others are added from the new growth, continually enriching the seed reserve in the soil (Ejeta et al., 2000).",2011,"2006) Apart from the direct negative effects of low soil fertility on agricultural production and food security, low soil fertility increases susceptibility of the crop to biotic pests.

Most important species of genus are Striga asiatica, S. hermonthica and Striga forbesii which are mainly found on cereals such as maize, sorghum, pearl millet and rice (Mbwaga et al., 2007). An impoitant factor in the Striga life cycle is the production of large numbers of minuscule seeds that cause rapid increase in parasite population density once the first infestation has occurred (Horton, 1990). The seeds remain dormant until they are chemically triggered by the host plant to germinate (Kwacha, 2001). The large number of parasitic seeds produced increases the chances that some Striga seeds will find a suitable host. Every year some seeds germinate, some revert to dormancy while others are added from the new growth, continually enriching the seed reserve in the soil (Ejeta et al., 2000).

Objective: To evaluate outcomes of the ETV and ETV-CPC procedures as surgical options for selected forms of hydrocephalus in Zambia. Methods: Between 2007 and 2010, 131 children with hydrocephalus underwent the ETV or ETVCPC procedures at Beit Cure Hospital (BCH) and were eligible for the analysis. Failed ETV was defined as cases that needed subsequent surgical procedures within 6 months of operation. Results: A total number of 110 (84%) children underwent ETV-CPC and 21 (16%) had ETV alone. The overall success rate was 74%, whereas ETV-CPC was 76% and ETV alone was 62%(p< 0.0001). ETV success rate was more likely with children aged one year and above (p< 0.06) and with non-post infectious hydrocephalus (p< 0.29).

It is an inherited disease of the bones, which is characterized by fragility that causes affected individuals to have recurrent fractures that subsequently lead to pain, deformity and disability. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Osteogenesis Imperfecta and identify the common deformities and treatment methods used in managing affected individuals at the Zambia Italian Orthopedics Hospital. Methods: This was a retrospective cross sectional survey. A data capture sheet was used to collect data from records and descriptive trend analysis was done in excel. Results: We identified 18 patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta out of 8250. The age range was 1 to 17 years. Eighty-three percent (n= 15) of these patients had deformities which included; bowed lower limbs, scoliosis and other related complications. All the patients underwent surgery at one point in time and received physiotherapy. Conclusion: The prevalence of Osteogenesis Imperfecta at the Zambia Italian Orthopaedics Hospital Community Based Rehabilitation Project is low. Surgery is the most commonly used method of treatment coupled with physiotherapy. Though uncommon, the condition is expensive to manage for both the institution and affected individuals’ families. This is as a result of repeated surgeries and prolonged physiotherapy.

For this purpose, carbon fibre–reinforced epoxy and glass fibre–reinforced phenolic resin samples, differing in thicknesses, were chosen. The primary aim was to investigate the effect of using multiple layers on the thermal degradation and fire reaction properties of the composite material using a cone calorimeter.

Design/methodology/approach–A detailed analytical model is established and validated by replicating the response of FSFBs. The validated finite element modelling method is then used to perform sensitivity analysis. First, the influence of the airgap presence is analysed, and later, the effect of the airgap size on thermal behaviour and structural response of FSFBs at elevated temperatures is investigated. Findings–Results from the study demonstrate that the presence of the airgap has a considerable influence on their thermal behaviour and structural response of FSFBs. The size of the airgap, however, has no significant influence on their thermal and structural response in fire.

Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We reviewed literature correlating Zika virus to microcephaly, epidemiology of the virus and its genetic, occurrence and possible transmission in Zambia. Methodology: We searched online databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and ISI Web of Science and critically reviewed appropriate publications to extract consistent findings, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest future studies. Results: After the screening process, 44 articles and bulletins were critically reviewed. In outbreak studies, pregnant women were either living in areas of ongoing transmission, had resided in, or travelled to ZIKV-affected areas during pregnancy. In the case of the Zambian Study, serology tests were conducted on selected residents in the Western and Northwestern Provinces to detect Zika virus antibodies. Aedes spp. which are vectors of the Zika virus were reported in Zambia as well. There lies a strong correlation between Zika virus infection and microcephaly as proven epidemiologically and experimentally through mice experiments. Genetically the Asian lineage of Zika virus has undergone adaptive changes in the genome resulting in improvement of the NS1 translation in humans.

When adjusted for inflation, levels of tobacco tax have not changed since 2007. Moreover, roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, a less-costly alternative to factory-made (FM) cigarettes, is highly prevalent. We modelled the probability of FM and RYO cigarette smoking using individual-level data obtained from the 2012 and 2014 waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Zambia Survey. We used two estimation methods: the standard estimation method involving separate random effects probit models and a method involving a system of equations (incorporating bivariate seemingly unrelated random effects probit) to estimate price elasticities of FM and RYO cigarettes and their cross-price elasticities. The estimated price elasticities of smoking prevalence are −0.20 … ",https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&oe=ASCII&user=ou_TKVAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ou_TKVAAAAAJ:0d9pApVQ-n0C
